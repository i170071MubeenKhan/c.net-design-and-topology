# Computer Netwrok Design and Topology

A small network design implemented using EIGRP, OSPF, RIP, and DNS protocols as well as NAT mapping and ACL filtering in **Cisco Packet Tracer**. This project was made for the semester project of course _Computer Networks (C.NET)_.

The objective of this project was to test understanding of different protocols by implementing them in this project.

**Project Guidelines:** [pdf](assets/CNET Project.pdf)

**Protocols Config. Commands:** [pdf](assets/protocols_config_commands.pdf)
